# Summary
In this challenge, I was asked to analyze school district information based on multiple different schools. The data set provided included school name, school type, math score, reading score, number of students, student IDs, student names andk grades. 
Analyzing this data set using PANDAS allowed me to see specific information such as the average math and lowest reading scores, number of students in each grade, school types and their individual academic scores, and much more. Results show that ninth graders in charter schools have the highest math scores. Results also show that Montgomery High School has the largest number of students at 2038 students.
